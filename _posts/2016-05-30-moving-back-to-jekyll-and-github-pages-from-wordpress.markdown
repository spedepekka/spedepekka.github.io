I used GitHub pages some time ago to host my site, but then I thought I should
try Wordpress. All those cool plugins etc. seemed to be cool and useful. After a
while I figured out the new Wordpress pages were slow and I didn't want to spend
my time optimizing the site or learn to use caching in WP. One of the reasons
why I didn't write content was, because I didn't like the editor in WP. I just
wanted to write and publish stuff without too much hassle. Plain and simple.

Now I'm moving back to Jekyll and GitHub Pages, because I've had very good
experiences with Jekyll in my internal and personal blogs. Yeah, you read
correctly. I use Jekyll to store my own tutorials and this way there is almost
no pain publishing the most useful to public.
