I came back to software business couple years ago, because that SEO-thing didn't go eventually so well. I worked for [Boogie](https://boogiesoftware.com/) again for couple of years and now I'm a freelancer.

I learned marketing isn't really my thing. I use SEO for own sites, but not really besides that.

So soon there should be some improvements here as well.
